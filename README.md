# Beware the Dragons

This is an old snaphot of the excellent emacs config at
[Clojure for the Brave and True](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure/).  That might be a much better source of information that anything here.

# Fun Clojure Presentations

This repo also includes a forked copy of
[live-code-talks.el](https://github.com/david-christiansen/live-code-talks).
This enables slides of clojure code which can be run and paged through for
live presentations.  The amount of code that can
be put on a slide is very small.  Maybe a plain repl is a better idea?
