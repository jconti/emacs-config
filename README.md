Emacs 28.2 configuration mostly for Cider/Clojure on JVM.

On macos, 28.2 has a problem initializing [see this](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/74289/emacs-28-2-error-in-macos-ventura-image-type-invalid-image-type-svg), but code should in `init.el` to work around this and be removed for later emacs releases.
